 # resincalc pre-pre-alpha instructions
 
how to use:
1. modify config.json for your desired sim (see example config for how to do this)
2. open command prompt in the "resincalc" folder
3. use the command "go run ."

example config: 
```json
{
    "main_stat": {
        "1flower": "hp",
        "1feather": "atk",
        "1sand": "def%",

explanation: <br />
in main_stat, for each of the four characters you want artifacts for, enter their wanted mainstats.<br />
in desired_subs, first enter the substats each character desires, in the format "(charnum)(stat)": (statvalue), for example, "3cr": 0.33 means that character 3's artifacts must have a total of 33% crit rate from substats<br />
then, set the artifact sets each character will use. this uses the format "(charnum)(2pcset)": (artifactid). each number corresponds to one artifact set, and even numbers are treated as being in the same domain as the odd number one lower.<br />
follow the example below: <br />
<br />
Let's say we want character1 to use 2pcEmblem + 2pc SR, character2 to use 4ToTM, character3 to use 2SR + 2TF, and character4 to use 2PF + 2BSC.
```
"11": 1,       we set character 1's first set as id 1, which we will use as emblem.
"12": 2,	   shimenawa is in the same domain as emblem, so it should be exactly emblem+1
"21": 3,	   character2 uses 4pc ToTM. We set this as artifact id 3.
"22": 3,       since character2 uses a 4pc, their 2nd 2pc set is also ToTM.
"31": 2,	   character3 has 2pc Shimenawa. we already defined this as id 2, so we use it here.
"32": 5,	   character3's second 2pc set is thundering fury. We define this as 5, because 4 is considered to be in the same domain as 3(which is totm).
"41": 4,	   now, we define Pale Flame as 4, since it is in the same domain as ToTM so its id should be exactly one above ToTM's.
"42": 7,	   finally, we define BSC as id 7, since it's not in any of the existing domains.
